The given Java code represents a program that demonstrates the use of different data structures for reversing the contents of a file. 
The program measures the execution times of reversal operations using ArrayList, LinkedList, and Deque data structures. 
It prompts the user to input file names and prints the execution times of the reversal methods. 
Additionally, it calls a method from another class, PartB, which can read in a file and word from the user and output the number of times the word appears.

The main method instantiates an object of the PartA class, performs various file reversal operations, prompts the user for input file and output file names,
prints the elapsed time for each operation, and finally calls the printWords method from the PartB class.

The partA class has different methods that finds the times of iterating through different lists in different ways. 
The partB class allows the user to input a word from a file chosen and have their word shown by the amount of times read from the file.
